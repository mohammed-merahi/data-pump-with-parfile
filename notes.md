# Notes: Oracle Data Pump Export with Parfile

## üß† Author Insights

This module was built to demonstrate a clean, reusable way to perform Oracle Data Pump exports using parfiles. It‚Äôs part of my ongoing effort to document real-world DBA workflows and make them teachable.

## üß© Design Choices

- **Parfile structure**: I used `schemas=ORCL` and `parallel=2` to show how to export a full schema efficiently.
- **Directory object**: Named `dpump_dir` to keep it generic and reusable across environments.
- **Wrapper script**: Simple `run_export.sh` to keep the execution clean and portable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Add timestamped dump/log filenames for daily rotation
- Create multiple parfiles for different schemas or table-level exports
- Add `impdp` module for full migration workflows
- Wrap in cron job or Ansible playbook for automation
- Add wallet status check for encrypted exports

## üß™ Testing Notes

Tested on Oracle 21c with autolog
